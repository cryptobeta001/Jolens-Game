# Jollen's Game

Jollen, also known as Holen, is a beloved traditional game in the Philippines that has been enjoyed by generations of children. This is a modern adaptation of the game with score tracking, leaderboard, reset functionality, and simple sounds.

## How to Play

1. **Objective:** The goal of Jollen is to hit your opponent's marble out of a designated circle or to hit them with a well-aimed shot. The first player to successfully hit the opponent's marble wins the round.
2. **Equipment:** Marbles (traditionally made from clay, stone, or polished nuts)
3. **Rules:**
    - Setup: Draw a small circle on the ground to serve as the target area. Each player places their marble inside this circle.
    - Taking Turns: Players take turns trying to hit their opponent's marble out of the circle.
    - Shooting: The shooter holds their larger marble in the crook of their index finger and flicks it with their thumb, aiming to hit the opponent's marble.
    - Scoring: If the shooter successfully knocks the opponent's marble out of the circle, they win that round. If not, the opponent gets a chance to shoot back.
    - Winning the Game: The game can be played in rounds, and the player who wins the most rounds is declared the overall winner.
